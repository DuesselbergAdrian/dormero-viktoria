  chunks:
    - 'All factual answers must be grounded in stored sources. If confidence is low, say you don’t know and offer escalation.'
    - 'Keep answers short (2–3 sentences) and include citations (title + URL).'
# Note: We’re using example.com placeholders for now. In PR2/PR7 we’ll replace with real sources + a sources.md. But schema + ingestion is correct.
